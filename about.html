            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why Computer Science?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>My initial interest in computer science came from my extended involvement in the game Runescape. I discovered the world of macroing: externally programming the game to play itself. I had no idea how it was done, or even where to begin, but I was obsessed with the concept. I started my first Java programming class in junior year with my best friend Doug, another person eager to learn about the world of software development. Admittedly, my skills in coding didn't develop as quickly as I had hoped; I was dependent on Doug to walk me through the projects, debug my programs, etc. However, to my surprise, one day it all clicked. I embraced the mindset of a coder and was finally fluent enough to begin really developing my skills. My mind was set and I knew I would want to make a career in the computer science field. </p>

            <p> My love for programming and technology roots back to one of my long-time hobbies of playing video games. As mentioned above, I love PC gaming and have been enjoying it for over 10 years. Sports and fitness are also valued in my life, whether it's playing, watching, or even coaching. I've been actively playing tennis for almost 15 years, including three years of instructional experience at the local country club in my hometown of Hartville, Ohio.

            My real passion lies in music. If I'm not at a live show or a festival, chances are I've got my headphones in getting my daily dose of my favorite music from virtually all genres. One of my dream careers is to work as a software engineer for Spotify. Getting paid to work with music and work with their impressive internal systems sounds like a perfect career path for me! Check out my favorite genres below as well as one of my favorite songs of all time, "Staircase" by Radiohead.</p>
